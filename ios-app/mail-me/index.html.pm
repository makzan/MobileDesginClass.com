◊headline{Example Project—Mail Me}

We’re going to build an app that takes a text input via extension.

We’ll learn the following:

- Take text in share extension
- POST to API with AlamoFire
- Sending mail using MailGun service

It uses the AlamoFire library to access the MailGun API to send email.
