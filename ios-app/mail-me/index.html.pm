◊headline{Example Project—Mail Me}

We’re going to build an app that takes a text input via extension.

We’ll learn the following:

- Take text in share extension
- POST to API with AlamoFire
- Sending mail using MailGun service

It uses the AlamoFire library to access the MailGun API to send email. You will need to download the library source code. You may also sign up a free account on MailGun website.
