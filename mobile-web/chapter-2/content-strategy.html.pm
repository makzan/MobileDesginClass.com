◊headline{Content strategy}

Why we should care about content first?

Because no matter how the web and app present our content, the content itself doesn’t change. So the first thing we should focus is the content structure.

By structure, I meant the important order of our content. I meant the correct headings for our content. The informative HTML tags we applied to our content.
