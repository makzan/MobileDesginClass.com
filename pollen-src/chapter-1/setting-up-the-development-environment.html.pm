◊h1{Setting up the development environment}

How can we get started?

We need to install some softwares. We need web browsers to run the web. We’ll need Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari to test our web pages.

Just the browsers? How about the editor?

Any plain text code editor would work. IDE such as Dreamweaver may be used but they are not required. For me, I would use Sublime Text because of the multiple-cursors feature.
