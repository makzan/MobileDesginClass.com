How we test our website?

◊section["simulator"]{Testing in simulator}

We will also need to install emulator for both iOS and android system.

The iOS simulator can be installed via the XCode, the apple development toolkit. The android emulator, on the other hand, can be installed via the android SDK. Alternatively, 3rd party emulator may be used, such as ◊link["https://www.genymotion.com/"]{genymotion}.
