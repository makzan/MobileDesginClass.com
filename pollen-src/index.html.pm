◊headline{Mobile Design Class}

You’ll find 3 topics in this ◊em{mobile design class}. They are ◊strong{mobile web design}, ◊strong{iOS app development} and ◊strong{Mobile UI Design}. You may read the online version for ◊em{free}, or you may buy the eBook edition.

The course was originally hosted on ◊link["http://makzan.net"]{makzan.net}. I’m migrating and updating the content into this domain.

Why there are 3 topics? It’s because they are deeply connected. If you want to design for mobile screens, you need the native UI components to build iOS apps. You need mobile web design skills to create hybrid app that runs both native code and web view code. You also need to learn mobile user interface design to provide a better user experience.
