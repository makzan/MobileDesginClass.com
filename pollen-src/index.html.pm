◊headline{Mobile Design Class}

There are 3 topics in this ◊em{mobile design class}. They are ◊strong{mebile web design}, ◊strong{iOS app development} and ◊strong{Mobile UI Design}.

You can find ◊em{free} online book in this website.

The course was originally hosted on ◊link["http://makzan.net"]{makzan.net}. I’m migrating and updating the content into this domain. After the migration, I will also cerate eBook edition.



Why there are 3 topics? It’s because they are deeply connected. If you want to design for mobile screens, you need the native UI components to build iOS apps. You need mobile web design skills to create hybrid app that runs both native code and web view code. You also need to learn mobile user interface design to provide a better user experience.
